# Haskell Brainf\*ck Interpreter

This repository contains a Haskell interpreter for the "Brainf\*ck" esoteric
programming language. It is described in a blog post
[here](https://www.digitaltorterra.com/haskell-brainfk).

This program requires GHC to operate. It has been tested on GHC version 8.8.4.
